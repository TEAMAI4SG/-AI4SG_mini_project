So far you have learned about the potential of AI in our course. In this project, you are carrying on the mission of using AI to address some of the most important social issues, i.e., **AI for Social Good (AI4SG)**. In particular, you will dive deeper into some of the most up-to-date AI technologies, their cases, and then brainstorm and propose solutions to address one of the social issues in your community.

Sounds too ambitious? Don‚Äôt worry, you will be walked through three steps: 

- **Part 1:** explore commonly used AI technologies through demos ‚Äì these are your tools!
- **Part 2:** learn about how other companies/organizations used AI technologies for social good ‚Äì these are your inspirations!
- **Part 3:** identify a topic and propose your solution! ‚Äì this is your project!

## üåç Before getting started, let‚Äôs warm up a little bit!
- check out this video get familiar with our missions in align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs): [Do you know all 17 SDGs?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XTBYMfZyrM) Check each of the goals and discuss with your team: any theme that resonates with you **in your own communities**?

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 1. Artificial Intelligence Technologies
First, you are going to explore a few core AI technologies through the lens of different companies, such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Adobe, and a few others. 

You will be introduced to different types of AI technologies through brief summaries about the topic and their respective demos. Most of the demos will provide a hands-on opportunity to learn more about how these technologies work whether you are a tech enthusiast or new to the digital realm. 

In this part, you will run the demos of the services listed below and consider what each service is and what the service can provide. Get ready to witness the power of creativity and intelligence converging as we delve into cutting-edge tools. 

### üé® 1. Generative AI 
Generative AI, at its core, breathes life into machines, enabling them to autonomously produce diverse, human-like outputs, from text to art, pushing the boundaries of innovation.

You can try out generative AI for yourself through ChatGPT (Click here!) , but keep in mind that you will have to create an account. To see how this tool can be used to generate images, you can explore Adobe Express (Click here!). 

If you are interested in generative AI services by other companies, feel free to check out the following resources: Gemini, Claude, DALL¬∑E 3, and Adobe Firefly.
